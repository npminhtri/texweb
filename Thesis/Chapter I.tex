\chapter{$\SLR$} % Sets article title

In this chapter, I will give an exposition on the structure of $\SLR$ as the spaces of lattice, this space
plays the role of a toy model before exploring the space of lattice in the higher rank. The exposition follows
the paper \cite{} and  \cite{} closely.
\section{$\SLR$ and its action on the upper half plane $\uH$}
A priori, the upper half plane
\[\uH = \left\lbrace z: \Im z >0 \right\rbrace \subset \mathbb{C}\]
has no group structure on its. However, we will show below that it can identify topologically with the space
with the space of cosets $\SO22\backslash\SLR$, and thus we can study the spaces $\uH$ via the spac of lattices $\SO2\backslash\SLR$.
We define the action of $G= \SLR$ on $\uH$ as follows
\[
  \begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{bmatrix} \circ (z) = \frac{dz -b}{-cz + a}
\]
\begin{prop}\label{h-as-matrices}
  The group $\SLR$ stabilizes \(\mathfrak{H}\) and acts transitively on it. In particular,
  \[
    \begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{y}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 & -x \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}(i) = x + iy \quad (\text{for } x \in \mathbb{R}, \, y > 0)
  \]
  Further, for \(g = \begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{bmatrix} \in SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})\) and \(z \in \mathfrak{H}\),
  \[
    \text{$\Im$}\,g(z) = \frac{\text{$\Im$}\,z}{|cz + d|^2}.
  \]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  The first formula is clear. The second formula would imply that the upper half-plane is stabilized. Compute directly:
  \[
    2i \cdot \text{$\Im$} \left( \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix} \circ(z) \right) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d} - \frac{d\overline{z} + b}{c\overline{z} + d} = \frac{(az + b)(c\overline{z} + d) - (a\overline{z} + b)(cz + d)}{|cz + d|^2}
  \]
  \[
    = \frac{adz - bc\overline{z} - bcz + ad\overline{z}}{|cz + d|^2} = \frac{z - \overline{z}}{|cz + d|^2}
  \]
  since \( ad - bc = 1 \).
\end{proof}
The point $z = i$ is special, in the sense that its stability group is the orthogonal group $K =\SO2$. Indeed, for any \(g = \begin{bmatrix}d & -b \\ -c & a\end{bmatrix} \in SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})\)  we have
that
\[g \circ i = i \Leftrightarrow \dfrac{ai+b}{ci+d }=i \Leftrightarrow a=d \text{ and } b = -c \]
Combinining with the fact that $ad-bc=1$, we must have $a^2 + b^2=1$. This implies that there is a $\theta$ such that $a = \cos\theta$ and $b = \sin \theta$.
Since $G$ acts on $\uH$ transitively, we know from group theory that there is a bijection between the collection of cosets of
$\text{Stab}(i)$ in $G$ and the orbits of $i$. In particular
\begin{prop}\label{upper-group}
  We have an isomorphism of \(SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})\)-spaces
  \[
    \SO2\backslash\SLR \cong \mathfrak{H} \quad \text{via} \quad  SO(2)g \to g^{-1}(i)
  \]
  That is, the map respects the action of \(\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})\), in the sense that
  \[
    (\SO2 g)\cdot h \;\longrightarrow\; h^{-1}(g^{-1}i)
  \]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  This is because of \textit{associativity}:
  \[
    (\SO2 g)\cdot h  = (\SO2)\cdot (gh)  \;\longrightarrow\; (gh)^{-1}(i) = h^{-1}(g^{-1}(i))
  \]
  giving the result.
\end{proof}
\section{Fundamental domain for $\Gamma = SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on $\mathfrak{H}$}

  \end{tikzpicture}\]
The goal of this section is to prove that under the action of the $\Gamma = \slz$, we can "move"
every points on the upper half plane to a domain, under an equivalence given by a specific action.
This is similar to the fundamental domain given by the translation action of $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is the half-open
unit interval $[0,1)$. In general, this give a simpler description to the homogenous space of lattice.

Note that when we try to compute the fundamental domain of $\mathbb{Z}\backslash \mathbb{R}$, we have $\mathbb{Z}$ plays a role of
\textit{discrete} subset of $\mathbb{R}$. We give a precise definition of discreteness as follows
\begin{definition}
  Let a group $G$ act continuously on a topological space $X$. A subset $\Gamma \subset G$ is called \textbf{discrete} if for any two compact subse
  $A,B$ in $X$, there are only finitely many $g \in \Gamma$ such that $g \circ A \cap B \ne \emptyset$.
\end{definition}
We will prove that the set
\[\Gamma = \slz = \left\lbrace \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b \\
    c & d
  \end{bmatrix} \in \SLR: a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Z}\right\rbrace\]
is a discrete subgroup of $G = \SLR$.
To prove this, we first need the following lemma
\begin{lemma}\label{lm2}
  Fix a real number $r>0$ and $0<\delta<1$. We denote $R_{r,\delta}$ the rectangle
  \[R_{r,\delta} = \left\lbrace z = x+iy: -r \le x \le r, 0 <\delta \le y \le \delta^{-1}\right\rbrace\]
  Then for any $\epsilon >0$ and any fixed set $\mathbb{S}$ of coset representatives for $\Gamma_\infty\backslash \Gamma$, there are finitely
  many $g \in \mathbb{S}$ such that $\Im(g\circ z)>\epsilon$ for some $z \in R_{r,\delta}$.
\end{lemma}
In the above lemma, the notation $\Gamma_\infty$ is defined to be the set
\[ \Gamma_\infty = \left\lbrace\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & n \\
    0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}: n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\rbrace.\] It can be seen easily that this is the
stability group of $\infty$ in $\mathfrak{H}$.
\begin{proof}
  Let \( g = \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix} \). Then for \( z \in R_{r, \delta} \),
  \[
    \text{Im}(g \circ z) = \frac{y}{c^2 y^2 + (cx + d)^2} < \epsilon
  \]
  if \( |c| > (y \epsilon)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \). On the other hand, for \( |c| \leq (y \epsilon)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \leq (\delta \epsilon)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \), we have
  \[
    \frac{y}{(cx + d)^2} < \epsilon
  \]
  if the following inequalities hold:
  \[
    |d| > |c| r + (y \epsilon^{-1})^{\frac{1}{2}} \geq |c| r + (\epsilon \delta)^{-\frac{1}{2}}.
  \]
  Consequently, \(\Im(g \circ z) > \epsilon\) only if
  \[
    |c| \leq (\delta \epsilon)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \quad \text{and} \quad |d| \leq (\epsilon \delta)^{-\frac{1}{2}} (r + 1),
  \]
  and the total number of such pairs (not counting $(c, d) = (0, \pm 1), (\pm 1, 0)$) is at most $\frac{4(r+1)} {(\epsilon \delta)}$. This proves the lemma.
\end{proof}
It follows from Lemma \ref{lm2} that $\Gamma = \text{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete subgroup of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. This is because:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item It is enough to show that for any compact subset $A \subset \mathfrak{H}$ there are only finitely many $g \in SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ such that $(g \circ A) \cap A \neq \phi$;

  \item Every compact subset of $A \subset \mathfrak{H}$ is contained in a rectangle $R_{r,\delta}$ for some $r > 0$ and $0 < \delta < \delta^{-1}$;

  \item $((\alpha g) \circ R_{r,\delta}) \cap R_{r,\delta} = \phi$, except for finitely many $\alpha \in \Gamma_{\infty}$, $g \in \Gamma_{\infty}\backslash \Gamma$.
\end{enumerate}

To prove (3), note that Lemma \ref{lm2} implies that $(g \circ R_{r,\delta}) \cap R_{r,\delta} = \phi$ except for finitely many $g \in \Gamma_{\infty}\backslash \Gamma$. Let $S \subset \Gamma_{\infty}\backslash \Gamma$ denote this finite set of such elements $g$. If $g \not\in S$, then Lemma \ref{lm2} tells us that it is because $\Im(g \circ z) < \delta$ for all $z \in R_{r,\delta}$. Since $\Im(\alpha g \circ z) = \Im(g \circ z)$ for $\alpha \in \Gamma_{\infty}$, it is enough to show that for each $g \in S$, there are only finitely many $\alpha \in \Gamma_{\infty}$ such that $((\alpha g) \circ R_{r,\delta}) \cap R_{r,\delta} \neq \phi$. This last statement follows from the fact that $g \circ R_{r,\delta}$ itself lies in some other rectangle $R_{r',\delta'}$, and every $\alpha \in \Gamma_{\infty}$ is of the form $\alpha =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & -m \\
    0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  (m \in \mathbb{Z})$, so that
\[
  \alpha \circ R_{r',\delta'} = \{x + iy \mid -r' + m \leq x \leq r' + m, \, 0 < \delta' \leq \delta''^{-1}\},
\]

which implies $(\alpha \circ R_{r',\delta'}) \cap R_{r,\delta} = \phi$ for $|m|$ sufficiently large.
Now we are ready to describe the fundamental domain for $\slz \backslash \uH$.
\begin{prop}\label{prop2}
  A fundamental domain for $\uH/ \slz$ can be given as the region
  \[\mathfrak{D} = \left\lbrace z=x+iy \in \uH: |z| \ge 1,-1/2 \le x \le 1/2 \right\rbrace ,\]
  modulo the congruent boundary points symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  First we eliminated the repeated points on the boundary. Note that the line $x = -1/2$ is the same as
  the line $x=1/2$ under the transformation $z \mapsto z+1$. Similarly, given a point on the circle
  $\left\lbrace |z|=1\right\rbrace$, the transformation $z \mapsto -|z|^{-1}$ satisfies
  \[\dfrac{-1}{x+iy} = \dfrac{-x+iy}{x^2+y^2}=-x+iy,\]
  which flips the sign of $x$. Thus it identifies the half circle on the right of the imaginary axis with that on the left.

  Now we need to show two things:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For any $z \in \uH$ we can find an element $g \in \slz$ such that $g\circ z \in \mathfrak{D}$.
    \item If $z \equiv z' \in \mathfrak{D}$ modulor $\slz$, then either $\Re(z)=\pm\frac{1}{2}$ and $z'=z\mp 1$, or
          $|z|=1$ and $z' = \frac{-1}{z} $.
  \end{enumerate}
  First we prove for (1): Fix $z \in \uH$. It follows from Lemma \ref{lm2} that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there are at most finitely many $g \in \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ such that $g \circ z$ lies in the strip
  \[
    D_{\epsilon} := \left\{ w \ \middle|\ -\frac{1}{2} \leq \mathrm{Re}(w) < \frac{1}{2},\ \epsilon \leq \mathrm{Im}(w) \right\}.
  \]
  Let $B_{\epsilon}$ denote the finite set of such $g \in \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$.
  Clearly, for sufficiently small $\epsilon$, the set $B_{\epsilon}$ contains at least one element. We will show that there is at least one $g \in B_{\epsilon}$ such that $g \circ z \in D$. Among these finitely many $g \in B_{\epsilon}$, choose one such that $\Im(g \circ z)$ is maximal in $D_{\epsilon}$.
  If $|g \circ z| < 1$, then for $S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $T=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
  we have, for any $m$,
  \[\Im\left( T^mS g \circ z \right)= \Im\left(\dfrac{-1}{g\circ z}\right)=\dfrac{\Im(g\circ z)}{|g\circ z|^2} > \Im(g\circ z)\]
  But we can choose $m$ such that $T^m S g\circ z \in D_\epsilon$, which contradicts the maximality of $\Im(g\circ z)$.

  Next we give a proof for (2):Let $z \in D$, $g = \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix} \in \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$, and assume that $g \circ z \in D$. Without loss of generality, we may assume that
  \[
    \Im(g \circ z) = \frac{y}{|cz + d|^2} \geq \Im(z),
  \]
  (otherwise just interchange $z$ and $g \circ z$ and use $g^{-1}$). This implies that $|cz + d| \leq 1$ which implies that $1 \geq |cy| \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}|c|$. This is clearly impossible if $|c| \geq 2$. So we only have to consider the cases $c = 0, \pm 1$. If $c = 0$ then $d = \pm 1$ and $g$ is a translation by $b$. Since $-\frac{1}{2} \leq \Re(z), \Re(g \circ z) \leq \frac{1}{2}$, this implies that either $b = 0$ and $z = g \circ z$ or else $b = \pm 1$ and $\Re(z) = \pm \frac{1}{2}$ while $\Re(g \circ z) = \mp \frac{1}{2}$. If $c = 1$, then $|z + d| \leq 1$ implies that $d = 0$ unless $z = e^{2\pi i / 3}$ and $d = 0, -1$. The case $d = 0$ implies that $|z| \leq 1$ which implies $|z| = 1$. Also, in this case, $c = 1$, $d = 0$, we must have $b = -1$ because $ad - bc = 1$. Then $g \circ z = a - \frac{1}{z + 1}$. It follows that $g \circ z = a - e^{2\pi i / 3}$ and $d = 1$, then we must have $a - b = 1$. It follows that $g \circ z = a - \frac{1}{z + 1} = a + e^{2\pi i / 3}$, which implies that $a = 0$ or 1. A similar argument holds when $z = e^{\pi i / 3}$ and $d = -1$. Finally, the case $c = -1$ can be reduced to the previous case $c = 1$ by reversing the signs of $a, b, c, d$.
\end{proof}
\section{Lattices and semi-stability in dimension $2$}
In this section, we investigate the notion of semi-stable lattices and how the
upper half plane $\uH$ can be regard as a spaces of two dimensional lattices.

Now regard $\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}^2$ via $x+iy \mapsto (x,y)$, and the inner product is defined to be
\[\left\langle z_1, z_2 \right\rangle = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2,\]
where $z_i= x_i+iy_i$. Now for any $z \in \uH$, the pair $(1,z)$ can be identified with the lattice
\[L_z = \mathbb{Z}z \oplus \mathbb{Z}\]
First we prove the following statement
\begin{prop}
  The upper half plane $\uH$ classifies similarity classes of two dimensional lattice.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\mathbb{Z}e_1\oplus \mathbb{Z}e_2$ be any lattice in $\mathbb{R}_2$. Then using the
  above identification, we can find two complex number $z_1,z_2$ such that $|z_1| = ||e_1||$ and
  $|z_2| = \lvert e_2 \rvert$
  \todo{add this later, refer to the book by Anton Deitmar}
\end{proof}
Clearly in each classes of similar lattice, there is a unique one that has unit covolume.
The lattice spanned by $z$ and $1$ has volume $y$, so the corresponding unit lattice is the one spanned
by $z/\sqrt{y}$ and $1/\sqrt{y}$.

Using Proposition $\ref{prop2}$, it is immediate that every lattice spanned by $1$ and $z$
is similar to lattice generated by $1$ and a point $z'$ inside ther region $\mathfrak{D}$.

Historically, in two dimension, Proposition $\ref{prop2}$ is first discovered by Lagrange, with the distribution
of Gauss to solve for the shortest vector problem in two dimensional space. In the language of modern mathematics,
it can be phrased as follows:
\begin{prop}
  If $L$ is any lattice, and $u$ is a primitive vector in $L$, and $v'$ is a vector in the sublattice
  $L^\prime = L/\mathbb{Z}u$, then there exists a unique representative $v$ of $v'$ such that its projection onto $u$ lies in the interval
  $(-u/2,u/2]$. Moreover, the following inequality holds
  \[||v||^2 \le \dfrac{||u||^2}{4}+||v'||^2,\]
  where we identify $v'$ with a vector $v^\perp$ in the orthogonal complement of $u$.
\end{prop}
\begin{remark}
  Here the primitive vector is the vector such that it is not the multiple of any other vector in the lattice.
\end{remark}
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Shortest vector.png}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}

To see why every point $z \in \uH$ can be transformed into a point inside $\mathfrak{D}$,
we start with a lattice generated by the $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of $1,z$ and
consider the shortest vector $u$. Applying the above lemma, we can find a vector $v$ with the length as least
as large as that of $u$. So if we rotate and scale to get $u=1$, the vector $v$ will lie
in the strip $(-1/2,1/2]$ and has the length at least 1. This clearly show that $v$ is a point in the domain
$\mathfrak{D}$.


\vspace{\baselineskip}
Now Grayson - following a prior idea of Stuhler - associated every lattice to a sort of \textbf{Newton Polygon}.
We will set up a graph coordinate in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First we construct a two dimensional coordinate, say $Oxy$
  \item We highlight the origin.
  \item If we are dealing with the lattice $L$, compute the area of the fundamental domain of $L$
  \item Assign the point $(2, \log(\vol(L)))$ to the line $x=2$ in the coordinate.
  \item If $v$ is any primitive vector, we put the point $(1,\log(||v||))$ in the set.
\end{enumerate}
Note that the lattice is discrete, so we can find a shortest vector $v$ of the lattice $L$. This will
correspond to the lowest point on the axis $x=1$ in the diagram. Note the that $x$-coordinate
of each of these point reflects its dimension.

As an example, let's consider the lattice of the following shape - with the shortest vector
$u$ has the length $||u||<1$.

Clearly for each dimension, we have the corresponding lowest point, and so the convex hull of
the plot is bounded from below. Grayson calls the plot on the left \textbf{ canonical plot} of the lattice and
the boundary of the convex hull of the canonical plot its \textbf{canonical polygon}. In the expository \cite{}
of Bill Casselman, he instead calls the canonical polygon as \textbf{profile}. We will use the terminology of Casselman.

Now we will try to understand the profile of a lattice associated to a point $z \in \mathfrak{D}$. First we
prove a simple observation
\begin{lemma}
  If $z \in \mathfrak{D}$ then the lattice $L_z = \mathbb{Z}z\oplus \mathbb{Z}$ admits 1 as the shortest vector.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We identify $z = x+iy$ with $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $1$ with $(1,0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$.
  Assume that $1$ is not the shortest vector, then there exists $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
  \[ |az+b|^2 < 1 \Leftrightarrow (ax+b)^2+(ay)^2 < 1\Leftrightarrow a^2|z|^2+2abx+b^2< 1\]
  Since $z \in \mathfrak{D}$, we clearly have $|x| \le \frac{1}{2}$ and $|z| \ge 1$,  thus the integers $a,b$ must
  satisfy
  \[ a^2 -|ab|+b^2 < 1\]
  Since the above expression are symmetric, we can assume $|a| \ge |b|$ and completing the square yields
  \[\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{3}b}{2}\right)^2 \ge a^2-ab+b^2 <1 \Rightarrow b^2<4/3 \Rightarrow b \le 1\]
  Substituting $|b|=1$ yields $|a|^2-|a|<0$. There is no non-zero integer $a$ satisfying this condition.
\end{proof}
The area of the lattice $L_z$ is given by $\det\begin{bmatrix}
    y & x \\
    0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix} = y$. Note that we can scale the basis by a factor $a=\sqrt{y}$ so that we get a lattice of volume $1$.
So the lowest points with respect to the axes $x = 0,1,2$ are $(0,0), (1,-\log(a))$, and $(2,0)$.
The interesting part of $\mathfrak{D}$ is where $y\le 1$. This corresponds to the lattices
that have the canonical plots lying entirely on or above the $x$-axis. In particular, the profile of such a lattice
only has the vertices at the origin and $(2,0)$. Grayson and Stuhler call this kind of lattice
\textbf{semi-stable}. If we don't normalize the area of such a lattice, then a semi-stable
lattice has the bottom of the profile as a straight line.

Conversely, the lattices assigned to the points $z \in \uH$ with $\Im(z)>1$ correspond to lattices
that have the canonical plot breaking at the lowest point on the axis $x=1$. In the general case, this reflects the fact that
a non semi-stable lattice has the shortest vector $u$ satisfying $||u||<\sqrt{\vol(L_z)}$. Following Casselman,
we call such a lattice \textbf{unstable}. In some sense, we can see that \textit{the degree of instability} is measured
by the shortest vector compared to its volume. In the above lemma, we only find the semi-stable locus inside the fundamental domain.
To find the semi-stable locus for the whole upper half plane $\uH$, we use the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}
  If $L_z$ is semi-stable, then so is the lattice $L_{g \circ z}$, where $g \in \SLR$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  If we denote $L_z=\text{span}_\mathbb{Z}\left\lbrace 1,z\right\rbrace$, then $L_{\gamma\circ z} = cL_z$ for some complex number $c$.
  Indeed, we just need to check for $\gamma$ being an inversion or translation, since these two transformations generate $\SLR(\mathbb{Z})$, but this is easy.
  Now let $c = re^{it}$. Multiplying by $e^{it}$ doesn't change the length, hence doesn't change the semi-stability. Multiplying by a positive number
  $r$ will shift $(1,\log|u|)$ to $(1,\log|u|+\log r)$ and $(2,\log(\vol(A)))$ to $(2,\log(\vol(A))+2\log r)$.

  \todo{I think in 2-dimensional case, c is 1}

  The line segment $d$ connecting the origin with the final point intersects the line $x=1$ at $(1,\log(\vol(A))+\log r)$. By the semi-stability of the original lattice,
  the point $(1,\log|u|+\log r)$ is above the line segment $d$.
\end{proof}
From this lemma, we can see that the semi-stable locus is the complement of the Farey balls in the upper half plane, as illustrated in the
following figure, where the blue part is the semi-stable locus and the gray part is the unstable one.

\section{$\rho$-semi-stability of lattices}
The semi-stability can be defined in a more Lie-theoretic way. First we recall the Iwasawa decomposition
for $\SLR$.
\begin{prop}
  We have
  \[\SLR \cong K \times A \times N\]
  where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $K=\SO2$: the special orthogonal group.
    \item $A = \left\lbrace \begin{bmatrix}
              a & 0      \\
              0 & a^{-1}
            \end{bmatrix}: a >0 \right\rbrace$.
    \item  $N = \left\lbrace \begin{bmatrix}
              1 & b \\
              0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}\right\rbrace$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{prop}
Combinining with Proposition \ref{h-as-matrices}, we have the following identification
\[\uH \cong A \times N\]
via the map
\[x+iy \mapsto \begin{bmatrix}
    1/\sqrt{y} & 0        \\
    0          & \sqrt{y}
  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & -x \\
    0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix} = a\left(y\right)n(x)\]
Let's denote $\sl2$ the Lie algebra of the Lie group $\SLR$ - the vector space of traceless matrices of size $2 \times 2$. We denote
$\mathfrak{h} = \mathbb{R}H$ where $H =\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0  \\
    0 & -1
  \end{bmatrix}$ its standard Cartan subalgebra. We then have the map
\begin{align*}
  H_B \colon \uH \to \mathfrak{h}, \quad
  z = x+iy \mapsto \log(a(y))H = \frac{-1}{2}\log(\Im(z))
\end{align*}
Let $\alpha\colon \mathfrak{h} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the unique linear function such that
$\alpha(H)=2$. If we let $\rho = \dfrac{1}{2}\alpha$, then we define
\[\deg_{\text{inst}}(z):= \min_{\gamma \in  \Gamma/\Gamma \cap B} \left\langle \rho,H_B(z\gamma) \right\rangle\]
where $B$ is the group of upper triangular matrices with invertible entries along the diagonal.
\begin{definition}
  The lattice $L_z$ corresponds to the point $z \in \uH$ is called \textbf{$\rho$-semistable} or just \textbf{semi-stable}
  if $\deg_{inst}(z) \ge 0$.
\end{definition}
We shall use this definition to find the semi-stable locus in the upper half plane $\uH$.
\begin{prop}
  The locus of $\rho$-semistable points in the upper half plane $\uH$ is the
  complement of the Farey balls.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  We first make simple observation: If $\deg_{\text{inst}}(z)$ is achieved at some
  $\gamma_0 \in \Gamma$ and $z$ is $\rho$-semistable, then
  \[\left\langle \rho, H_B(z\gamma)\right\rangle \ge 0 \mbox{ for all } \gamma \in \Gamma\]
  From this observation, the $\rho$-semistable locus must be the set
  \[ \left\lbrace z \in \uH: \left\langle \rho, H_B(z\gamma)\right\rangle \ge 0 \mbox{ for all } \gamma \in \Gamma \right\rbrace\]
  We identify $z=x+iy$ with the product $a(y)n(x)$ as above. Under the identification \ref{upper-group}, we must have
  \[\left\langle \rho, H_B(z\gamma) = -\log(a(\gamma^{-1} \circ z)) \right\rangle\]
  Assume that $\gamma^{-1} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a & b \\
      c & d
    \end{bmatrix}$, then $\gamma^{-1} \circ z$ satisfies
  \[\Im(\gamma^{-1}\circ z) = \dfrac{\Im(z)}{(cx+d)^2+(cy)^2}\]
  Thus, $z$ is semistable if and only if it satifies the inequalities
  \[y \le(cx+d)^2+(cy)^2  \Leftrightarrow \left(x+\dfrac{c}{d}\right)^2+\left(y-\dfrac{1}{2c^2}\right)^2 \ge \left(\dfrac{1}{2c^2}\right)^2 \]
  for any $c,d$ coprime. Since the above equation is exactly the equation for Farey balls, we are done.
\end{proof}
In particular, we just proved that the $\rho$-semistablility and the semistablility in Grayson's sense
are equivalent.
\subsection{Unstable lattices}
Consider an unstable lattice $L$ with a shortest vectur $u$, then the bottom
of the profile of $L$ has a break at the point $(1,\log(||u||))$. Clearly $u$ is a primitive vector, so $L_1 = \mathbb{Z}u$
is a sublattice of $L$. This determines a \textbf{lattice flag}
\[\mathcal{F}: 0 \subset L_1 \subset L_2 = L\]
And this is called the \textbf{canonical flag} associated to $L$. By tensoring with $\mathbb{R}$ we get
a flag of rational subspaces
\[0 \subset V_1 = L_1 \otimes \mathbb{R} \subset V_2 = L_2 \otimes \mathbb{R}\]
Conversely, for any rational flag $\mathcal{F}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we can denote $\mathcal{H}_\mathcal{F}$ the set of all
unstable lattices that gives rise to the flag $\mathcal{F}$. What can we say about the set
$\mathcal{H}_\mathcal{F}$? It turns out that the can be parametrized by the Farey balls in the complex plane.
\begin{prop}
  Given a flag of rational vector spaces
  \[\mathcal{F}: 0 \subset V_1 \subset V_2 =\mathbb{R}^2\]
  Assume that $V_1 = \text{span}(pf_1+qf_2)$ for some $\mathbb{R}$- linearly independent set $\{f_1,f_2\}$ . Then
  the set $\mathcal{H}_\mathcal{F}$ corresponds to the Farey balls that is tangent to the $x-axis$ at the fraction $p/q$.
  Morever, each Farey circle corresponds to the set of lattices with the same profiles.
\end{prop}

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The Farey Circles correspond to the same rational flag}
  \label{P-coordinate}
\end{figure}
\begin{proof}
  Consider the lattice $L=L_z \in \mathcal{H}_\mathcal{F}$ for $z = x+iy$. This lattice $L$ has a basis
  \[\begin{cases}
      f_1 = \dfrac{e_1}{\sqrt{y}} \\
      f_2 = \dfrac{-xe_1}{\sqrt{y}}+e_2\sqrt{y}
    \end{cases}\]
  Assume that $u=pf_1+qf_2$ is the shortest vector of $L$. Since $u$ is primitive, we must have $\gcd(p,q)=1$. Since the lattice
  $L$ is unstable, it follows that $\mu(L_1) \le \mu(L/L_1)$ for $L_1 = \mathbb{Z}u$. In particular, we have
  \[\dfrac{|-qz+p|}{\sqrt{y}} \le 1 \Leftrightarrow (-qx+p)^2 +(qy)^2 \le y \]
  If $q \ne 0$, this is the equation for the Farey balls that tangent to the horizonal axis at $(p/q,0)$. If $p=0$ then $q=1$, the equation
  $\dfrac{|-qz+p|}{\sqrt{y}} \le 1$ degenerates to $y \ge 1$. Hence we are done.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  Note that for every flag in $\mathbb{R}^2$ corresponds to a parabolic subgroup. For example, the subgroup 
  \[B = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & n \\
    0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}\]
  stabilizes the flag $0 \subset \mathbb{R}e_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ for some choice of basis $\{e_1,e_2\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Any parabolic subgroup of $\SLR$ is conjugate with $B$. So there is a correspondence between 
  rational parabolic subgroups of $\SLR$, that is, the parabolic subgroup that stabilizes a rational flag $\mathcal{F}$ - and the collections $\mathcal{H}_\mathcal{F}$ of lattices 
  gives rise to the flag $\mathcal{F}$. 
\end{remark}

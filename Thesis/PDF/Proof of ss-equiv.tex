In this chapter, we will establish the notion of semi-stable lattice. Heuristically,
this is the lattice that achieve all the successive minima at the same time, see \cite{}.

We will provide two different definitions of semi -stable lattice: one is geometric - which follows Grayson's idea of utilizing
the canonical plot, and one is purely algebraic, which make use of the maximal standard parabolic subgroups.
The toy model will be the moduli space of 2-dimensional lattice, which is essential the upper half plane in the complex field.
At the end, we will show that the two definitions coincide.
\section{Lattices and semi-stable lattice in higher rank}
For each $z$ with $\Im(z)>0$, we can attach to $z$ a lattice structure $L_z = \mathbb{Z}z \oplus \mathbb{Z}$. Roughly speaking
a lattice is a discrete  subgroup that is generated by a $k-$ basis of the $k$-space $V$.
In particular, we will only work with the real vector space $V$. Grayson works with lattice over a ring of algebraic integers, but we will restrict to
just the lattice that has the underlying structure as a $\mathbb{Z}-$ module.


The precise definition
of a lattice is as follows:
\begin{definition}[\label = Euclidean $\mathbb{Z}$-lattices]
    Let $L$ be a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module. In particular, it is a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module
    of finite rank. Suppose that $P$ is endowed with a real-valued symmetric positive definite\footnote{The non-degenerate implicity state that rank L is the same as $dim L_\mathbb{R}$} bilinear form, called $Q$.
    Then the space $L_\mathbb{R}= L \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{R}$ equipped with the bilinear form $Q$ forms a real
    inner product space. We will call  the pair $(L,Q)$ a \textbf{Euclidean $\mathbb{Z}$-lattice}.
\end{definition}
\todo{add proof showing $L$ is a lattice in the second definition}

If there is no further confusion, we can just denote a Euclidean lattice by $L$, without specifying the bilinear form
$Q$. The lattice $l$ determines a full-rank lattice inside $L_\mathbb{R}$, namely, the rank
of the lattice $L$ is equal to the dimension of $L_\mathbb{R}$. We first recall the definition of discrete subgroup
\begin{definition}
    Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, endowed with the natural topology. A subgroup $L$ of the additive group underlying the vector space $V$ is said to be \textit{discrete} if each point $y$ in $L$ has a neighbourhood in $V$ whose intersection with $L$ is $\{y\}$ or, equivalently, if, given a bounded set $C$ in $V$, the set $C \cap L$ is finite.
\end{definition}
Thus, using the following Proposition, $L$ has a structure of a discrete subgroup $V = L_\mathbb{R}$.
\begin{prop}
    Given a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$, let $L$ be a subgroup of the additive group $V$, and let $m$ be the dimension of the $\mathbb{R}$-span of $L$ in $V$. Then $L$ is a discrete subgroup if and only if $L$ is a free abelian group of rank $m$.
\end{prop}
A proof can be found in \cite{}.
We now can define the notion of covolume of a lattice:
\begin{definition}[\label = Volume]
    Let's assume that $L$ is a full-rank lattice and has a basis
    \[L = \mathbb{Z}l_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus\mathbb{Z}l_n\]
    Then the volume of this lattice is defined to be the volume of the fundamental
    parallepiped. In particular, let $\left\lbrace e_i\right\rbrace$ be any orthonormal
    basis of the vector space $V = L_\mathbb{R}$. Then
    \[\vol(L) := \left|\det Q(l_i,e_j)\right|\]
\end{definition}
However, for the sake of computation, we also usually adopt another definition of the lattice.
In particular, we view lattice as a free $\mathbb{Z}-$ module of rank $n$ that is isomorphic
to $\mathbb{R}^n$ via base changing.
In more detail
\begin{definition}
    A \textit{lattice} in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subset $L \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ such that there exists
    a basis $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that
    \[L = \mathbb{Z}b_1\oplus \mathbb{Z}b_2\oplus \ldots \mathbb{Z}b_n\]
    If we put the vector $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ in collumn, with respect to the standard basis, namely
    \[g = [b_1 | b_2 | \ldots | b_n] ,\]
    then $L = g\mathbb{Z}^n$.
\end{definition}
In the second sense, we can just identify $L$ with the standard lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the
symmetric positive definite form is $g^tg$.

Now, the basic problem we want to deal with is to classify "isomorphic" classes of lattice. Here
we say two lattices $L_1$ and $L_2$ are isomorphic if and only if there is a map $\gamma \in \glnz$ such that
\[\gamma \cdot g_1 = g_2,\]
Note that here we use the second point of view, i.e. we identify $L_i$ with the $\mathbb{Z}-$ module
$\mathbb{Z}^n$ associated to the form $g_i^tg_i$. If we define $X_n$ the space of all
symmetric positive definite bilinear form, then we are looking at the space $\glnz \backslash X_n$.

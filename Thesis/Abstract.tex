 In this thesis, we study the notion of semi-stable lattices in two dimensional space and generalize it to finite dimensional space of dimension at least 3.

 The semi-stable lattices can be defined using two different definition, as first defined using a plot as in \cite{MR780079} and later defined using Harish-Chandra map as in \cite{MR3969872}. We showed that 
 the two definition are equivalent and proved the equivalence between geometric properties using plot and algebraic properties using Harish-Chandra map. We achieve this by pointing out the volume of sublattices can be computed 
 using pairing between Harish-Chandra map with the Weyl vectors. In this way, the geometric information and algebraic information are the same.
  
 When the lattice is not semi-stable, which is called unstable, it can be attached 
 a canonical plot in geometric sense and a  canonical pair in algebraic sense. We also proved that these objects encode essentially the same data in finite dimensional case.

\title{Montel theorem and some related results} % Sets article title

\date{\today} % Sets date for date compiled

% The preamble ends with the command
\begin{document}
\maketitle % creates a title using the information in the preamble (title, author, date)
In this short note, I will recover the proof for Montel's theorem and some applications/consequences.
A nice result that follows from Montel's theorem is the Riemann mapping theorem - which says that
every simply connected set in complex plan $\mathbb{C}$ is either the whole plane or biholomorphic to the unit disk.

\section{Introduction}
In this section, I will define some concepts that will be used.

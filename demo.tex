\section{Quasi-metrics} % creates a section
\begin{definition}
    A function $d \colon X \times X \to [0,\infty]$ satisfying the condition
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $d(x,x) = 0 (x \in X)$
        \item $d(x,y) = d(y,x) (x,y \in X)$
        \item $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z) (x,y,z)$
    \end{itemize}
    then it is called a quasi-metric on space $X$. We can see that $d$ is almost the same as a metric except that $d(x,y)$ can be zero for distinct $x,y$.
\end{definition}

One can construct a metric $\overline{d}$ from quasi-metric $d$, noting that $d$ is an equivalence relation on $X$.

Now we introduction the notion of \textit{concave function}: The function $\psi \colon I \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be \textit{concave} if
\begin{align*}
    \psi(tx + (1-t)y) \le t\psi(x) + (1-t)\psi(y),
\end{align*}
for all $x,y \in X$ and $ 0 \le t \le 1$. It can be inferred from the definition that $\psi$ is concave iff $-\psi$ is convex. Now we have the following lemma
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose that $\psi \colon I \to \mathbb{R}$ is concave and $a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2 \in I$ such that $a_1 <b_1, a_2 <b_2, a_2 \ge a_1, b_2 \ge b_1$. Then
    \[\dfrac{\psi(b_2)- \psi(a_2)}{b_2-a_2} \le \dfrac{\psi(b_1)- \psi(a_1)}{b_1-a_1} \]
\end{lemma}
Geometrically speaking, the slope of the segment joining two points on the graph of $\psi$ decreases as the points moves to the right.

Applying this lemma for $a_1 =0, b_1=x = a_2, b_2=x+y$, we get the following result:
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose that $\psi \colon [0,\infty] \to \mathbb{R}$ is concave and $\psi(0)=0$. Then
    \[ \psi(x+y) \le \psi(x) + \psi(y),\]
    for all $x,y \ge 0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose that $\psi \colon [0,\infty] \to \mathbb{R}$ is concave and
    \[\psi(0)=0.\]
    Suppose further that $\psi$ is nondecreasing, $\psi(t) >0$ for $t >0$ and this function is continuous at $0$.

    If $d$ is a quasi-metric on $X$ then $\tilde{d} = \psi \circ d$ is also a quasi-metric on $X$
    such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tilde{d}(x,y)=0$ iff $d(x,y)=0$.
        \item $\tilde{d}(x_n,y_n) \to 0$ iff $d(x_n,y_n) \to 0$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
Now choosing $\psi$ to be a bounded function, we can further assume that $\tilde{d}$ is bounded. Two traditional choices are:
\[ \psi_1(t)= \dfrac{t}{t+1}\]
and
\[\psi_2(t) = \begin{cases}
        t \quad (0 \le t \le 1) \\
        1 \quad (t >1)
    \end{cases}\]

One might choose $\psi_1$ since it is a smooth function, or choose $\psi_2$ as it is easy to compute.
The main reason for choosing a new equivalent bounded quasi-metric because it is easy to add up.
For example, in the next lemma, showing that given a countabel family of quasi-metrics $(d_j)$, there exists a single quasi-metric $d$
such that $d(x_n,y_n) \to 0$  if and only if $d_j(x_n,y_n) \to 0$ for every $j$.

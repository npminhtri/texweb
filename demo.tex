% Question 1
\begin{exercise}
  Let $q \ge 2$ be an integer and let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character mod $q$. Consider the $L$
  \[L(z;\chi) := \sum_{i=1}^\infty \dfrac{\chi(n)}{n^z}\]
  which converges absolutely for $\Re(z)=:x >1$ since
  \[ \sum_{n\ge 1 }|\chi(n)n^{-z}| \ge \sum_{n\ge 1} n^{-x} <\infty,\]
  by the $p-$test from FPM. Show that $L(z;\chi)$ defines a holomorphic function on $X = \left\lbrace z \in \mathbb{C}: \Re(z)>1 \right\rbrace$
  and $L(z;\chi) \ne 0$ for all $z \in X$. Furthermore, show that
  \[\dfrac{L'(z;\chi)}{L(z;\chi)} = - \sum_p \dfrac{\chi(p)\log(p)}{p^z-\chi(p)};\]
  for $z \in X$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
  \hfill
  Using Weierstrass M-test as in the statement in the problem, we have proved that the sequence
  \[ L_N(z;\chi) = \sum_{n=1}^N \dfrac{\chi(n)}{n^z}\]
  converges uniformly to the function $L(z;\chi)$. In particular, $L(z;\chi)$ is continuous
  over the domain $X$. Clearly the sequence of functions $L_N$ are holomorphic on $X$, as it is just a finite sum of exponential functions, which are entire. Thus we have
  \[\int_{\gamma} L_N(z; \chi)dz = 0,\]
  for piecewise smooth closed curve $\gamma$ inside $X$, by Cauchy's theorem. Furthermore, we have
  \[\int_{\partial \Delta} L(z;\chi) = \lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{\partial \Delta} L_N(z,\chi) =0\]
  By Morera's theorem, we can conclude that $L(z,\chi)$ is holomorphic over the domain $X$. Here I used the notation  $\partial \Delta$ to indicate the boundary of a triangle.

  The domain $X$ is simply connected as it is convex. Using proposition 2.3 in the note, we can rewrite the $L-$ function as
  \[L(z;\chi ) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \dfrac{\chi(n)}{n^z} = \prod_p \dfrac{1}{1-\chi(p)p^{-z}}\]
  Here proposition 2.3 is just a rephrase of lemma 2.2, so I don't write down the proof again.
  Note that over $X= \left\lbrace z \in \mathbb{C}: \Re(z)>1 \right\rbrace$, we have
  \[\dfrac{1}{1-\chi(p)p^{-z}} = 1+ \chi(p)p^{-z}+ (\chi(p)p^{-z})^2+\ldots = 1+ \sum_{k\ge 1} \chi(p^k)p^{-kz}\]
  where
  \[\sum_{k\ge 1} |\chi(p^k)p^{-kz}| \le \sum_{n \ge 1} n^{-\Re z}<\infty\]
  Let denote $u_p(z)= \sum_{k\ge 1} \chi(p^k)p^{-kz}$, then
  \[L(z;\chi) = \prod_p \left(1+u_p(z)\right)\]
  Then $L(z;\chi)=0$ if and only if $u_p(z) =-1$ for some $p$. But this is impossible as
  \[|u_p(z)| \le \sum_{k\ge 1} |\chi(p^k)p^{-kz}| = \sum_{k\ge 1} p^{-k\Re z} = \dfrac{p^{-\Re (z)}}{1-p^{-\Re z}} =\dfrac{1}{p^{\Re z}-1} <1\]
  as the smallest prime $p$ is $2$. Thus $L(z;\chi)$ never vanishes on the domain $X$.

  Lastly, we will prove the identity for $\frac{L'(z;\chi)}{L(z;\chi)}$. Similarly the discussion of the note, we will prove that
  there exists a branch of the logarithm $\log L(z,\chi)$ on $X$ and satisfies
  \[\log L(z;\chi) = \sum_p \Log(1-\chi(p)p^{-z})\]
  We then define the partial sum $S_m = \sum_{p\le m} \Log(1-\chi(p)p^{-z})$. Clearly this partial sum is holomorphic and $S_m$ converges uniformly
  to a holomorphic function $F(z)$  as $ m \to \infty$. Using the remark - please see below - for $w = \chi(p)p^{-z}$ with $p \ge 5$, we have that
  \[\left|\Log(1+\chi(p)p^{-z})\right| \le 2|-\chi(p)p^{-z}| =2p^{\Re z} \le 1/2\]
  and similarly to above, we shown $\sum_{p}2p^{\Re z} <2 \sum_{n\ge 1}n^{\Re z} <\infty$. By Weierstrass M-test, $S_m$ converges uniformly to a holomorphic function $F(z)$ on $X$ as desired.

  This function $F(z)$ is then a branch of the $\log L(z;\chi)$.

  Indeed, first we can check that $S_m$ defines a brach of the function $P_m= \prod_{p \le m} (1-\chi(p)p^{-z})$. As shown above,
  we already had $P_m \to L(z;\chi)$ as $m \to \infty$. Thus the fact that $S_m \to F$ implies $e^F = L(z;\chi)$. In particular,
  $F(z)$ defines a branch of the logarithm  $\log L(z;\chi)$, namely
  \[\log L(z;\chi) = \sum_{p} \Log(1+u_p(z)) = \lim S_m(z)\]
  Thus
  \[S'_m(z) = -\sum_{p \le m} \dfrac{\chi(p)\log(p)}{p^z-\chi(p)} \to \frac{d}{dz}\left[\log(L(z;\chi))\right] = \dfrac{L'(z;\chi)}{L(z;\chi)}\]
  In particular, for $z \in X$, we have
  \[\dfrac{L'(z;\chi)}{L(z;\chi)}= -\sum_{p } \dfrac{\chi(p)\log(p)}{p^z-\chi(p)},\]
  where the sum extends over all prime number $p$, as we wanted.

  \textbf{Remark: } In order to prove that $S_m$ converges uniformly to a holomorphic function, we actually prove that following exercise:
  Consider the analytic function $f(w) = \Log(1-w)$, show that $| \Log(1-w)| \le 2|w|$ given $|w|<1/2$. Using the Taylor's series, we have
  \[ \left|\Log(1-w)\right| =\left| -\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{w^n}{n}\right| \le |w| \cdot \sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{|w|^{n-1}}{n} \le |w| \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty (1/2)^{n-1} \right) =2|w|\]
\end{proof}

% Question 2
\begin{exercise}\label{ex2}
  Let $G$ be a finite abelian group. Show that $\#\hat{G} \le \#G$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
  First we will prove that the set $S$ of maps $f\colon G \to \mathbb{C}$ has a vector space structure.
  The sum and the scalar multiplication of maps are defined as follows
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $(\chi_1 + \chi_2)(a) := \chi_1(a)+ \chi_2(a)$ for all $a \in G$.
    \item $(c\chi)(a):= c\cdot\chi(a)$ for any $\chi \in S$ and $c \in \mathbb{C}$.
  \end{itemize}
  But we can check all the axioms for a set being a vector space pointwisely, with the zero
  beging the zero map. We can verify as follows
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Additive closure: this is clear from the way we defined the sum of two functions in $S$.
    \item Commutative: For any $a \in G$, we have $\chi_1(a)+\chi_2(a) = \chi_1(a)+\chi_2(a)$. Since this holds for any $a \in G$, we have $\chi_1 + \chi_2 = \chi_2+\chi_1$.
    \item Associative: Similarly, for all $a \in G$
          \[(\chi_1(a) + \chi_2(a))+\chi_3(a) = \chi_1(a)+ (\chi_2(a)+\chi_3(a))\]
          In general
          \[(\chi_1 + \chi_2)+\chi_3 = \chi_1+ (\chi_2+\chi_3)\]
    \item The zero map is just the function $0 \colon G \to \mathbb{C}$ that sends everything to $0$.
    \item For a map $f \in S$, we can define its additive inverse to be $(-f)\colon G \to \mathbb{C}$ such that $(-f)(a) := -f(a)$. Clearly
          \[(f+ (-f))(a) = f(a) + (-f(a)) = 0, \forall a \in G\]
          Thus $f+(-f)$ is the zero map.
    \item The other axioms on the scalar multiplication can be checked pointwisely in the  exact same way.

  \end{enumerate}

  So $S$ have a a structure of vector space.

  Let's compute the dimension of $S$ as
  as $\mathbb{C}-$ vector space. Since $G$ is finite, we can assume that, as a set
  \[G = \left\lbrace a_1,\ldots,a_n \right\rbrace\]
  Then we can define the map $f_i$ to be the "dual" of $a_i$ in the following sense: $f_i(a_j) =\delta_{ij}$, i.e.
  $f_i(a_i)=1$ and vanishes at $a_j \ne a_i$. We claim that $\mathfrak{B}= \left\lbrace f_i \right\rbrace$ forms a basis of $S$.
  Indeed, let $f\colon G \to \mathbb{C}$ be arbitrary. Since $G$ is finite, $f$ is determined by its value at each $a_i \in G$.
  Assume that $c_i = f(a_i)$. Then for any $1 \le i \le n$, we have
  \[f(a_i) = c_i = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i f_i(a_i)\]
  In particular, we can rewrite the following identity as
  \[f = c_1f_1+c_2f_2+\ldots+c_nf_n,\]
  which implies $\mathfrak{B}$ spans $S$. On the other hand, if
  \[0 = c_1f_1+c_2f_2+\ldots+c_nf_n\]
  Applying both sides to $a_i$ yields
  \[0 = c_if_i(a_i) = c_i\]
  which means $\mathfrak{B}$ is a set of linearly independent vectors. Thus $\dim S = \#\mathfrak{B} = n$.
  In the note, we proved that the character $\chi_1,\chi_2,\ldots,\chi_m$ are mutually orthogonal. In particular, they are
  a subset of $S$ comprising of linearly independent vectors. Thus
  \[m = \#\hat{G} \le n = \# G. \]
  \textbf{Remark:} In fact, if we assume the theorem about the structure of finite abelian group, we can prove that
  the equality always happens, namely $ \#\hat{G} =\# G$
\end{proof}

%Question 3
\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex3}
  Consider the finite abelian group $G_9$ consisting of the invertible elements of $\mathbb{Z}/9\mathbb{Z}$. Find all the characteres of $G_9$.
  Make sure you prove that the characters of $G_9$ you find are all distinct and there are no others.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
  As a set, we can list the elements of $G_9$ based on the definition as
  \[G_9 = \left\lbrace 1,2,4,5,7,8\right\rbrace,\]
  where we excluded $3,6$ as they are not coprime with $9$. Here I use $a$ to indicate the class $[a]$ mod $9$.

  Using the Remark in the previous exercise, we expect $6$ characters in total. We will check that $2$ generates $G_9$, so it is a
  cyclic group of order $6$. Indeed, we have
  \begin{align*}
    2^1 \equiv 2 \pmod 9 \\
    2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod 9 \\
    2^3 \equiv 8 \pmod 9 \\
    2^4 \equiv 7 \pmod 9 \\
    2^5 \equiv 5 \pmod 9 \\
    2^6 \equiv 1 \pmod 9
  \end{align*}
  So the character is defined solely by determining where it sends $[2]$ in $\mathbb{C}$. Let $\chi \in \hat{G_9}$ be
  any character, we then have
  \[\chi(2)^6=\chi(2^6) = \chi(1) = 1 \in \mathbb{C}\]
  thus implies $\chi(2)$ must be a $6-th$ root of unity. There are $6$ choices in total, namely
  \[\chi(2) = e^{\frac{2i\pi k}{6}}, 1 \le k \le 6\]
  Clearly these are 6 distinct characters - as they have different values at residue class $[2]$ -  and they are all possible characters of $G_9$.

  We can compute a character table as follows:
  $\chi(n)\pmod{9}$ \\
  \[\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c }
      \hline
      $n$         & $1$ & $2$           & $4$          & $5$           & $7$          & $8$  \\
      \hline
      $\chi_1(n)$ & $1$ & $1$           & $1$          & $1$           & $1$          & $1$  \\
      $\chi_2(n)$ & $1$ & $\omega$      & $\omega^{2}$ & $-\omega^{2}$ & $-\omega$    & $-1$ \\
      $\chi_3(n)$ & $1$ & $\omega^{2}$  & $-\omega$    & $-\omega$     & $\omega^{2}$ & $1$  \\\rowcolor{lightgray}
      $\chi_4(n)$ & $1$ & $-1$          & $1$          & $-1$          & $1$          & $-1$ \\
      $\chi_5(n)$ & $1$ & $-\omega$     & $\omega^{2}$ & $\omega^{2}$  & $-\omega$    & $1$  \\
      $\chi_6(n)$ & $1$ & $-\omega^{2}$ & $-\omega$    & $\omega$      & $\omega^{2}$ & $-1$ \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}\]
  where  $\omega = e^{i\pi/3}$.
\end{proof}

%Question 4
\begin{exercise}
  Show that there is exactly one real, non-principal Dirichlet character $\chi \pmod 9$. Find $\chi(916)$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
  Continuing from the previous exercise, with a note that a character is called real character if its image lies entirely in
  $\mathbb{R}$, namely  we have a group homomorphism $\chi\colon G_9 \to \mathbb{R}$. Since we know that all character $\chi \in \hat{G}$ satisfy
  \[|\chi(a)| =1, \text{ for all } a \in G_9,\]
  we can deduce that a real character $\chi$ must satisfy $\chi(G_9) \subset \left\lbrace \pm 1 \right\rbrace$. Since
  we want to find a non-principal character, the only choices is that $\chi(G_9) = \left\lbrace \pm 1\right\rbrace$. As shown
  above, $\chi$ is defined solely by its value at $2$, so we must choose $\chi(2) =-1$. This implies that there is only
  one non-principal, real Dirichlet character over $G_9$.

  Note that $916 \equiv 16 = 2^4 \pmod 9$. Thus
  \[ \chi(916) = \chi (2^4) = (\chi(2)^4) = (-1)^4=1.\]
  And we are done.

  \textbf{Remark:} Note that if we already have the full character table as computed in the previous exercise, it can be deduced immediately that
  there is a unique non principal real Dirichlet character mod 9.  In the given table, it is the character $\chi_4$ - corresponds to the highlighted row.
\end{proof}\newpage
We have that
\[5^{7x} = 7^{5x} \Leftrightarrow \log_5(5^{7x})=\log_5(7^{5x}) \Leftrightarrow 7x = 5x\cdot\log_5(7) \Leftrightarrow x(7-\log_5(7))=0 \Leftrightarrow x =0\]
